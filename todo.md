## TODO
* Make the Makefile and make sure fractol.h work → try and compile all the oceano code
* Go through the oceano code and make sure you undertand everything → make ankii cram deck on all the oceano content / active recall like the control flow
* watch oceano videos on minilibx libriary explaination → make sure to understand everything etc
(this is all copied to todoist)

### Things to do


if you want to test compile the code is


gcc *.c -Lminilibx-linux -lminLinux -lX11 -lXest -o fractol


-L  ->> the directory where the librairy is
-l  ->> the actual librairy to include
-lX11 ->> things that explained in another video -- go watch this video
-lXest ->> things that explained in another video -- go watch this video
